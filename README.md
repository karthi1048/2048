## 🎮 Gameplay

The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number **2048**.

- Use **arrow keys** (↑ ↓ ← →) to move tiles.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they **merge into one**.
- The game ends when there are no valid moves left.
